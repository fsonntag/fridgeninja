**FridgeNinja**
A smart fridge tracker.
Built for the Jacobshack Hackathon in Fall 2015.

The app detects who opens the refrigerator and asks him which drinks he took.
User detections is based on Bluetooth LE, so the user either way has a modern smartphone with him or a Beacon device.
By default the app shows an overview of the drinks left in the fridge and the history of items taken and put into the fridge.
